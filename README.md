# Ecosoft Documentation Template

This template is based https://www.sphinx-doc.org with extention for slides from https://github.com/nyergler/hieroglyph.

The template can be used as guideline in building documentation for projects, which will provide following benefits,

* Based on .rst format, which we are used to when working with github readme.
* Sphinx-doc provide write once product many format, i.e., html, slides, pdf (still problem with Thai), epub, etc.
* Sphinx-doc is also a defacto standard for opensource project, including Odoo. It is good to learn anyway. :)

## How to setup?

1. In your github $PROJECT, copy `doc` folder from here.
